# APK-Patcher Lite

Flashable Zip Template for Modifying System APKs On-Device

Based on [APK-Patcher](https://github.com/osm0sis/APK-Patcher) by osm0sis @ xda-developers


## Information

This is a modified version of APK-Patcher that will delete / inject files into System APK files instead of using a baksmali / apktool method.

The method used here is a similar method used in my ROMs to patch files, where instead of having to have like for example 4 SystemUI files, I only needed to keep the actual files that were changed. This method could also be used quite easily to apply OTA updates or addons on already pre-modified APK files.


## Usage

* Copy your pre-compiled resource files (including .dex files) to the patch folder, removing the .apk part of the filename (ie: SystemUI)

* Create a file in scripts with the same name (ie: SystemUI.sh) if you want to delete any existing files from the APK

* Make edits to envvar.sh, and also to extracmd.sh if needed


### Properties / Variables (envvar.sh)

* banner="";
* apklist="";
* apkbak=/data/media/0/APK-Backup;
* backup=1;
* cleanup=1;

**banner** is the name of your patch zip, usually suggestive of what it does, to be displayed at the beginning of the zip flash. You should include your name/handle here like "by osm0sis @ xda-developers" for credit purposes.

**apklist** is a string containing the list of APKs to be patched included in the patch zip, separated by spaces between the quotes. Each APK is automatically found recursively in /system, then copied to the working directory to be decompiled and acted on, then copied back to /system.

**apkbak** is the location to place backups of the untouched APKs in apklist if backup=1 is set.

**backup=1** will store backups of the untouched APKs in the location specified in apkbak.

**cleanup=0** will keep the zip from removing it's working directory in /tmp/apkpatcher - this can be useful if trying to debug in adb shell whether the patches worked correctly. cleanup=1 is necessary on multi-APK patching zips, so it's recommended each APK to be patched be tested on their own with cleanup=0 before combining into a single zip.


### envvar.sh

Modify the envvar.sh to add your banner, apklist, backup and cleanup options

Multiple files can be patched, put a space between the filenames (ie: apklist="file1.apk file2.apk";)


### extracmd.sh

Modify the extracmd.sh to add any additional commands to be performed at the end of the patching process that aren't patch-related (/data file changes,


### scripts/$apkname.sh

* fileremove="";

$apkname is the name of the folder that you put your resources files in. Copy scripts_sample.sh and rename it to your APK (ie: SystemUI.sh)

Multiple files can be deleted, put a space between the paths (ie: fileremove="/res/drawable/file1.png /res/drawable/file1.png";)
